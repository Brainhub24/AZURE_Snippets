# Repository: Azure_Snippets
This repository contains a collection of useful code snippets for Azure administrators. With Azure being a vast platform, managing it can be overwhelming, which is why having a collection of code snippets at your disposal can significantly reduce time and effort required for tasks like resource management, building/deploying templates, and monitoring resources.

# Snippets
The repo contains collections of snippets that are organized into different categories such as ARM Builder, Check Tools, Scanners, and Bots. These categories are tailored to cover the majority of tasks a developer or administrator might encounter in the Azure platform.

# ARM Builder Snippets
The ARM Builder Snippets include sample code scripts that can be used to build Azure Resource Manager templates. These templates will allow you to create and manage resources in a more effective and efficient way.

# Check Tools Snippets
The Check Tools snippets provide code examples that can be used to ensure that Azure resources are configured correctly. Automated checks using these snippets make it possible to detect misconfigurations and vulnerabilities that can impact security, and compliance posture.

# Scanners Snippets
The Scanners snippets provide scripts that can be used to scan Azure resources for potential vulnerabilities or misconfigurations. By carrying out these scans, users can identify any security loopholes and take actions to mitigate potential risks.

# Bots Snippets
The Bots snippets contain code that allows you to implement Azure Bots, which can be used to automate specific aspects of your administrative or management duties.

# Future Developments
More snippets will be added in the future to cover additional categories, improve existing scripts, and support more extensive functionality.

Feel free to download and use these snippets as you see fit. Contributions and suggestions for new snippets or any issues can be submitted through GitHub using the issues feature or a pull request.
